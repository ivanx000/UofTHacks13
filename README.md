# ShopOut - Shop For Outcomes

> Transform your aspirations into curated product recommendations with AI-powered personalization and 3D visualization.

## 🎯 Overview

ShopOut is an intelligent shopping assistant that understands your goals and lifestyle aspirations, then recommends products that align with your vision. Instead of searching for specific items, describe what you want to achieve — whether it's "feeling more settled in my apartment" or "hosting the best dinner parties" — and get personalized product suggestions powered by Google's Gemini AI.

### Key Features

- **🧠 Natural Language Understanding**: Describe your goals in plain language
- **🎨 3D Product Visualization**: Interactive 3D models powered by Three.js and React Three Fiber
- **📚 Persistent User Memory**: Learns from your preferences and interaction history
- **🔍 Multi-Platform Search**: Aggregates products from Amazon, eBay, Google Shopping, and more
- **🤖 AI-Powered Recommendations**: Leverages Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite for intelligent product matching
- **📊 Cached Responses**: Smart caching system to optimize API usage and performance

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend (FastAPI + Python)
- **FastAPI** REST API with CORS support
- **Google Gemini AI** for natural language processing and recommendations
- **SQLite** database for user memory and interaction history
- **Multi-platform product search** with intelligent caching
- **Structured logging** for AI decision tracking

### Frontend (Next.js + TypeScript)
- **Next.js 16** with App Router
- **React Three Fiber** for 3D rendering
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **TypeScript** for type safety

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Google Gemini API key
- SerpAPI keys for extended product search

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   SERPAPI_KEY=your_serpapi_key_here   
   ```

5. **Run the backend server:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Frontend-Used Endpoints

- **`POST /recommend`** - Get AI product recommendations based on vibe (with smart routing)
  - If user has clear vibe → generates product recommendations
  - If user is unsure + has history → suggests vibes based on patterns
  - If user is unsure + no history → general recommendations


- **`POST /search-products`** - Search for specific products on Google Shopping


### Additional Endpoints (for monitoring/debugging)

- **`GET /`** - Root endpoint with API status and memory statistics
- **`GET /user/{user_id}/history`** - Retrieve user's recommendation history (limit: 10)
- **`GET /stats`** - Get memory database statistics
- **`GET /logs/recent`** - View recent AI decision logs (limit: 20)
- **`GET /logs/user/{user_id}`** - Get all AI decision logs for a specific user

## 🎨 Features Deep Dive

### User Memory System

- Considers explicit preferences (vibe, prompts, values)
- Generates creative product combinations

### 3D Visualization
- Interactive 3D product models
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive camera controls
- Custom 3D models for various product types

### Backend Issues

**Port already in use:**
```bash
# Kill process on port 8000
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9
```

**Missing API keys:**
- Ensure `.env` file exists in `backend/` directory
- Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `SERPAPI_KEY` is set correctly

### Frontend Issues

**Module not found errors:**
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**3D models not loading:**
- Verify model files exist in `public/models/`
- Check browser console for CORS or path errors
